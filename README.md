# Text Animations Collection

I put this together because I kept struggling to find a solid collection of ready-to-use GSAP text animations that we see on award-winning websites. Every time I needed to add text animations, I ended up rebuilding the same things from scratch, or just couldn't find resources to learn how to build them. So I created this repo to have a go-to set of practical examples using SplitText, ScrambleTextPlugin, and ScrollTrigger that not only I, but anybody can reuse.
I've added various character-based, word-based, and line-based text animations that I came across (16 in total at the time of writing this). If you have an animation suggestion, feel free to let me know or send a PR.
